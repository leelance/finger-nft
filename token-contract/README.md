### Pre Requisites

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC
? Enter value: â€£ here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend

npx hardhat vars set INFURA_API_KEY

# C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\hardhat-nodejs\Config\vars.json
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
npm run typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
npm run test
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
REPORT_GAS=true npm run test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
npm run clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
npm run deploy:contracts
```

### Tasks

#### Deploy Lock

Deploy a new instance of the Lock contract via a task:

```sh
npm run task:deployLock --unlock 100 --value 0.1
```

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `bun run coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar to turn the server
on/off.

## Local development with Ganache

### Install Ganache

```sh
npm i -g ganache
```

### Run a Development Blockchain

```sh
ganache -s test
```

> The `-s test` passes a seed to the local chain and makes it deterministic

Make sure to set the mnemonic in your `.env` file to that of the instance running with Ganache.
